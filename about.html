                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Elizabeth, a software developer with a passion for video games and AI. I love creating new and fun things with code, <br>and I'm always eager to learn more and improve my skills.<br><br>

                    I got into software development because of my love for video games. I grew up playing games like Super Mario, and Zelda I was<br>fascinated by how they were made.That's how I started learning programming and discovered the amazing possibilities of software.<br><br>
                    
                    One of the things that excites me the most about software development is AI. I think AI is one of the most powerful and innovative technologies of our time, and I love <br>exploring its applications and challenges.I'm especially interested in chatbots, and how they can make communication and interaction more natural and engaging. I use bing AI for image generation, software development help, or for creating new ideas!<br><br>
                    
                    When I'm not coding or playing games, I enjoy spending time with my adorable puppy, who always makes me smile and relax. I also like<br> to volunteer at a local farm, where I help with farming crops and handing out food to the locals. I think it's important to give back to the community and help those in need.<br><br>
                    
                    If you want to know more about me, my projects, or my services, feel free to contact me anytime. I'd love to hear from you and chat<br> about anything related to software, games, or AI. Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
